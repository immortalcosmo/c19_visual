# COVID 19 Data and Disualization  

bigqueryCounty.py uses SQL with Google BigQuery to obtain public data and write to .csv.  
plotCounty.py reads the .csv file and writes figures for each day with specified start and ending dates.  
countyAPNG.py utilizes all figures and forms the animated PNG you see here.
